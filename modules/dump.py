    "The Ender dragon is a dangerous, flying hostile boss mob found when first entering the End. She is the largest naturally spawning mob in the game, and is widely acknowledged as the final boss of Minecraft.\n",
    "The Ender dragon spawns immediately when a player first arrives in the End.\n",
    "Players can re-summon the Ender dragon once the fight is over by placing four end crystals on the edges of the exit portal, one on each side. When the dragon is re-summoned, a series of explosions resets the obsidian pillars, iron bars, and end crystals. The top of each pillar appears to explode, destroying any player-placed blocks. If the player does not pick up the dragon egg and starts to re-summon the dragon, the dragon egg disappears.\n",
    "Once slain, the Ender dragon slowly ascends, her wings and body becoming more tattered until she disappears, while beams of light erupt from her center. There's an explosion of 12,000 experience points (ten drops of 960 and one drop of 2400) — enough to bring a player from level 0 to level 68. In subsequent completions of the Ender dragon fight (after she is re-summoned via the End crystals), only 500 experience points are dropped.\n",
    "After the dragon is slain for the first time, a dragon egg appears above the island's central bedrock structure. The bedrock structure fills in with an End portal interface to become the exit portal, enabling the player to transport back to the Overworld and respawn at their spawn point.\n",
    "Every completed dragon fight also creates an End gateway portal floating within 75–100 blocks of the exit portal, up to a maximum of 20 gateway portals.\n",
    'During the battle with the Ender dragon, unique music called "Boss" plays. The battle also keep loaded several chunks around the X,Z=0,0, regardless if the player is present. Both of these happen for as long as the player fights the dragon.\n',
    "The Ender dragon has a light purple health bar that appears at the top of the player's screen. Her health is frequently restored by nearby End crystals, indicated by a magical white beam connecting the dragon and the crystal. Destroying an End crystal that is actively healing the dragon causes 10 damage to her. \n",
    "The dragon can take damage only from explosions and player based damage, and takes 1⁄4 normal damage when hit on any part that is not her head. Suffocation is completely non-applicable, as she either phases through or immediately destroys any block she touches.\n",
    'The dragon is immune to all status effects, such as poison and even "instant" effects like instant damage.\n',
    "By using the F3\u202f+\u202fB shortcut, the dragon's bounding box appears. She cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub-hitboxes are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: The tail, body, head, and wings.\n",
    "The Ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground. She flies around the end main island while fighting the player.\n",
    "The dragon can pass through all blocks, destroying almost all types. Blocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island and those that are intended to be indestructible (with the exception of crying obsidian and respawn anchors):\n",
    "Destroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.\n",
    "The dragon never targets any entity but the player. Other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when struck. Any entities hit by its wings are dealt 5 damage (or 10 damage if hit by its head) and are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island. Neither of these effects is applied for 1⁄2 second after the dragon takes damage.\n",
    "The Ender dragon has four main states of behavior:\n",
    "When the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, she flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless she cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.\n",

    "Dragon fireballs are special fireballs that the Ender dragon fires while strafing. They cannot be deflected unlike ghast fireballs, and they do no impact damage. Instead, they deposit purple clouds across the ground, similar to a lingering Potion of Harming II. As with her close-ranged breath attack, the purple fog can be bottled to obtain the dragon's breath.\n",

Setting the DragonPhase tag (by issuing either the /summon ender_dragon ~ ~ ~ {DragonPhase:0} or the /data merge entity <selector> {DragonPhase:0} commands) starts the Ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the End's dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself \u200c[JE only]. If spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see #Behavior).\n",
    "Target selectors for the Ender dragon target a total of 9 entities per dragon, as the Ender dragon actually consists of 9 entities internally \u200c[Java Edition only]. So executing at a dragon to summon an arrow summons 9 arrows.\n",
